	<p>Since Udemy is international it is very difficult to speak in an accent which everybody can understand and also I am not a native English speaker. SoÂ Incase if you face issues with understanding the accent, you can always use 0.75x and 0.5x speeds which are highly effective. Even I cannot exactly pick the english of some instructors and I used 0.75x which is very very effective. So please try this incase if you have such issues.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
